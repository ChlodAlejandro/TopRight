# Top Right
Top Right is a dodging-based game centered on a white ball with a trail. You must dodge rectangular obstacles and collect powerups to be able to get a high score.

# WARNING
***This game includes strong white and neon colors on a black background. There are also balls that blink every one second. If you are easily disoriented with these, I suggest that you either play this game as black and white (which some accesibility features have) or wait for the low-contrast mode that is still in development.***

# Gameplay
Move the ball by dragging on the screen. You may choose to let go anytime. The ball moves relative to the movement of your finger on the screen.

There are blue and yellow balls that appear. The blue ball is a shield that allows the player to take 1 hit. The yellow ball is an invincibility powerup that can make the player immune to obstacles for 5 seconds. Both balls blink every second.

Hitting an obstacle immediately kills you, if you didn't already guess. It also makes a loud obnoxious sound which is **just a placeholder. I'm not actually going to use it in the future.** The speed of the ball gets faster and faster until your score becomes 50, and the obstacles spawn more and more until an obstacle spawns every 1/32 seconds (theoretically.)

Getting too close to the sides also kill you. This is to deter campers. I'm still working on bottom-left campers, though.

# Important Notes
These builds are beta, and are not guaranteed to work on every device. They can break, and most of the time the game will not work correctly. But if it does, then congratulations, you have the right to get addicted to it and to brag your high score into my face on my [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/ChlodAlejandro).

As of b0017, the obstacle generation system is offset to the top left, therefore causing most obstacles and powerups to spawn near the top left. We're working on fixes to this, but it might take some time. The sounds as of the Sound Update are also INCREDIBLY obnoxious. You may want to turn down the volume when playing the game. A mute option will be added in future builds.

# Builds
These builds come straight from the Unity compiler. I've tried my best to compress them, but they always seem to be at least 20+ MB. I'm not good at optimizing code, so if anyone has any suggestions, feel free to tell me.

These builds work on a Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro 2018, running Android 8.0. I've only tested extensively on this device so far, so cut me some slack.

Also, if you stick to the bottom-right corner, you won't get hit. So don't send me a screenshot of your gameplay. Send me a recording. Because for all I know, you could hang at that bottom area for hours at a time.
